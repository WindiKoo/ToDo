# ToDo

This to do application is my practice project to learn JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
The base of the project has been made with help of a example video from the youtube.
After the instructed parts, I included my own color theme by creating new CSS -file
and tried different kind of clicking effeckts on the + -button and the other clickable items.
I plan to continue working on this project to learn more.
